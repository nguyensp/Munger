Imagine if you could ask Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to instantly value a company for you.
More than that, imagine if you could have an investment thesis for every public company available.
You could instantly sort through the most profitable opportunities within your circle of competence
that's directly in line with your core values.

With AI, I can now automate and scale the investment research process. Naturally I'll be leveraging
my own iOS Mobile Engineering expertise for my own use.

Eventually there will also be a feature to correlate your portfolio with other super investors. 
I also intend to create learning feature where you can go through the reasoning process of famous 
historical bets from prominent investors like Li Lu.

There will probably also be mobile portal for clients who'd like to work with me.

Anyway, cheers to AI which is force multiplier on software engineering learning and productive output.
